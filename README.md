### Hi there 👋

I'm a software engineer, technical lead, technologist, geek, husband, father, dog dad, gamer, and avid learner. Technology and software development are my passions. I enjoy solving complex problems, writing code, tinkering, and learning new technologies. I'm an opensource advocate and would like to contribute more to opensource. My background is primarily as a backend software engineer with a heavy emphasis on object-oriented programming, JVM languages and frameworks, and SQL databases. However, in 2019 I transitioned from mostly writting in Java/JVM technologies to Go with Kubernetes and Microservices. 

My primary tech stack:

* Go
* Azure
* AKS/Kubernetes
* Docker
* Java/JVM
* Kotlin
* Spring & Spring Boot
* PostgreSQL
* CockroachDB
* CosmosDB
* Kafka

Also know or work with:

* C#
* .NET
* Python

Interesting in Learning:

* Rust
* Neo4J
* Game Development
* Emulation Development
* Machine Learning
